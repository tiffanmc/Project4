# Project4
This repository contains files used for Project 4 in FYS4150 Computational Physics at UiO. The program was written in C++, 
the plots were done in Python (ipython notebook files), all produced figures are in the png folder and all necessary .txt and .dat files 
to plot with the Python codes are in the txtanddat folder.

To run the C++ program, select lattice size N, number of timesteps and number of temperatures (Ntemps) inside the program in order to run 
the Ising model and observe a phase transition where the system changes from a magnetic lattice to a system with zero magnetisation. 
This will produce a text file of temperatures, expectation energies, magnetic moment, specific heat and magnetic susceptibility. 
In order to run the first section of the project, comment out the desired part of the program, the sections are described with comments.

Enjoy! Andri & Tiffany
